    Jacob Wood & Zack Hance
    
    The final project will be the result of a collaboration between 
Zack Hance and Jacob Wood.  We will build upon Jacob's project 4 
framework.  Much work is still to be done such as menus, webpage, 
animations, and additional items as well and will be divided equally 
amongst those involved.  
    The basis of our storyline is that the player's character is stuck
in his own nightmare. He is in his house and must reach the end of the 
level which will be the front door or some exit. Along the way he meets
various enemies which he will have to defeat by throwing weapons and/or
using some type of strategy.  We also plan to incorporate some sort of 
puzzles or obstacles the player will have to figure out how to get past.
Once at the end of the level the player will have to fight a boss in 
order to proceed.  After the boss has been defeated the player will 
receive a key that will let him through the door and out of his 
nightmare... or possibly onto another nightmare level.
