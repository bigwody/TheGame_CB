        PARAGRAPH

    For my final project I have created a side scrolling game similar to
  Super Mario Bros.  The player must battle their way to the end of the level and
  defeat any enemies along the way using various weapons. I have included health
  and score as well.  There is a boss at the end of the level.  The player can jump 
  on top of an enemy to kill them and the jump from there as well.
